# Prerequisites

This is the starting point for the instructions on deploying the [AKS baseline multi cluster reference implementation](../../README.md). There is required access and tooling you'll need in order to accomplish this. Follow the instructions below and on the subsequent pages so that you can get your environment ready to proceed with the creation of the AKS clusters.

## Steps

1. An Azure subscription.

   The subscription used in this deployment cannot be a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free); it must be a standard EA, pay-as-you-go, or Visual Studio benefit subscription. This is because the resources deployed here are beyond the quotas of free subscriptions.

   > :warning: The user or service principal initiating the deployment process _must_ have the following minimal set of Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles:
   >
   > * [Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) is _required_ at the subscription level to have the ability to create resource groups and perform deployments.
   > * [User Access Administrator role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) is _required_ at the subscription level since you'll be performing role assignments to managed identities across various resource groups.

1. An Azure AD tenant to associate your Kubernetes RBAC Cluster API authentication to.

   > :warning: The user or service principal initiating the deployment process _must_ have the following minimal set of Azure AD permissions assigned:
   >
   > * Azure AD [User Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#user-administrator-permissions) is _required_ to create a "break glass" AKS admin Active Directory Security Group and User. Alternatively, you could get your Azure AD admin to create this for you when instructed to do so.
   >   * If you are not part of the User Administrator group in the tenant associated to your Azure subscription, please consider [creating a new tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization) to use while evaluating this implementation. The Azure AD tenant backing your cluster's API RBAC does NOT need to be the same tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

1. Latest [Azure CLI installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (must be at least 2.37), or you can perform this from Azure Cloud Shell by clicking below.

   [![Launch Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/includes/media/cloud-shell-try-it/launchcloudshell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)

1. While the following feature(s) are still in _preview_, please enable them in your target subscription.

   1. [Register the OIDC Issuer preview feature = `EnableOIDCIssuerPreview`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#oidc-issuer-preview)

   1. [Register the Federated Identity Credentials preview feature = `FederatedIdentityCredentials`](https://TODO)

   1. [Register the Workload Identity preview feature = `EnableWorkloadIdentityPreview`](https://TODO)

    ```bash
   az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" -n "EnableOIDCIssuerPreview"
   az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity" -n "FederatedIdentityCredentials"
   az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" -n "EnableWorkloadIdentityPreview"

   # Keep running until all say "Registered." (This may take up to 20 minutes.)
   az feature list -o table --query "[?name=='Microsoft.ContainerService/EnableOIDCIssuerPreview' || name=='Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/FederatedIdentityCredentials' || name=='Microsoft.ContainerService/EnableWorkloadIdentityPreview'].{Name:name,State:properties.state}"
   
   # When all say "Registered" then re-register the AKS and related resource providers
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ManagedIdentity
   ```

1. Install [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/#installation)

1. Login GitHub Cli

   ```bash
   gh auth login -s "repo,admin:org"
   ```

1. Fork the repository and clone it

   ```bash
   gh repo fork mspnp/aks-baseline-multi-region --clone=true --remote=false
   cd aks-baseline-multi-region
   git remote remove upstream
   ```

1. Get your GitHub username

   ```bash
   GITHUB_USER_NAME=$(echo $(gh auth status 2>&1) | sed "s#.*as \(.*\) (.*#\1#")
   ```

1. Ensure [OpenSSL is installed](https://github.com/openssl/openssl#download) in order to generate self-signed certs used in this implementation. _OpenSSL is already installed in Azure Cloud Shell._

   > :warning: Some shells may have the `openssl` command aliased for LibreSSL. LibreSSL will not work with the instructions found here. You can check this by running `openssl version` and you should see output that says `OpenSSL <version>` and not `LibreSSL <version>`.

1. Intall [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)

   Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS. It'll be used to generate a TLS cert for your Application Gateway instances.
